## How it Works ?

The Snake and Apple Game is built using the Pygame library in Python. The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen and consumes apples to increase its length. The player controls the snake's movement using the arrow keys on the keyboard. As the snake eats the apple, its length increases, and the player earns points. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or its own body.The game's constants are defined at the beginning of the code, such as the window size, the colors used, the speed of the snake, and the starting position of the snake and apple.

## Libraries used

Pygame - a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It provides functionality for handling graphics, sound, input, and more.
Random - a module in Python's standard library that provides functions for generating random numbers, selecting random items from lists, and shuffling sequences.
Time - a module in Python's standard library that provides functions for working with time, such as measuring elapsed time and pausing for a specified duration.

## How to configure

Install Python: The first step is to install Python on your computer if you don't have it already. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Install Pygame: Once you have Python installed, you need to install the Pygame library. You can do this by opening the terminal or command prompt and running the following command: pip install pygame
Download the project files: Download the Snake and Apple Game project files from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/DevikaaD/Tinkerhub--Hackernight.git. You can either download the ZIP file and extract it, or use Git to clone the repository.
Run the program: Navigate to the directory where the project files are located and run the snake_game.py file. You can do this by opening the terminal or command prompt, navigating to the project directory, and running the following command: python snake_game.py

## How to Run

Open the command prompt or terminal and enter the following command: pip install pygame
This will install Pygame on your computer.
Download the project files: Next, you need to download the project files from the GitHub repository. You can download the ZIP file and extract it or use Git to clone the repository.
Run the program: After downloading the project files, navigate to the directory where the files are located using the command prompt or terminal. Then, enter the following command: python snake_game.py
This will run the Snake and Apple Game program, and the game window should appear. You can use the arrow keys on your keyboard to control the snake and try to eat the apples without colliding with the walls or the snake's body.
